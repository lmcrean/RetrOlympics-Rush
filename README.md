## Game Research

- Simple sidescroller games such as Flappy Bird and Chrome Dino were researched as they had well resourced tutorials

## KaBoom.js Resources

Kaboom.js was used as our primary framework the team adapted various templates 

To begin with we used a template from the Kaboom.js website to get started and adapted the code to suit our needs.

- [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) Provided the library of functions for the game
- [Kaboom Playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) Kaboom had a library of code playgrounds that were particularly useful for quick testing of the framework functions
